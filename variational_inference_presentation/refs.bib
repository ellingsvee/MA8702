  abstract = {One of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate
              difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is
              especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all
              inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the
              posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference
              (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability
              densities through optimization. VI has been used in many
              applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as
              Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first
              posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that
              family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by
              Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field
              variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to
              exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian
              mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic
              optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern
              research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is
              powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing
              this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of
              algorithms.},
